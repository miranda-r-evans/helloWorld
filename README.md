# helloWorld - Bearer Tutorial
Bearer is an API framework, made for Holberton School's curriculum. It gives students a way to practice their documentation reading and software implementing skills. This is the result of going through the Hello World tutorial.

## Github
helloWorld is able to:
* list a user's repositories
* list a pull requests
* save a pull request
* save a pull request's state

## Script
In the Bearer dashboard, the resulting API integration is available as an HTML script tag. Example:
```
  
<script src="https://static.bearer.sh/68e78c/hello-world/dist/hello-world.js"></script>
```

## What Went Well
The tutorial was easy to use once I got rolling. The clipboard-copy functionality was nice to use.

## What Went Poorly
There were a lot of hiccups at the beginning of this project, with getting Vagrant configured and understanding how bearer works. One thing that's still not actually working is seeing pull requests. I thought I followed to tutorial exactly, but it's possible I'm missing something.

## Possible Improvements
Getting pull request functionality to work.
